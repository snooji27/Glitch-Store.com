 Whenever you want to edit something, make sure to create a new branch and edit there. Once you are happy with the code, you should merge the branch you are editing in with the main branch, BUT not before creating a pull request, so every member can look at the code before agreeing on merging. To prevent adding mistakes instead of fixing them.
